# ðŸ•º Pose Tracker with Feedback

A Python-based video processor that lets you select a person in a video, tracks them using a bounding box, detects body poses with MediaPipe, and gives basic feedback based on joint angles like knee and elbow.

## Running the Frontend

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory (if it's in a separate folder):

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/teresa2625/volleyball-video-feedback
cd frontend
```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:

```
yarn start
```

This will run the frontend server, and it will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Now, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The frontend will interact with the backend to process the video and generate feedback.
